# Curiosity_project
This repo is for project that was done as part of Curiosity models and applications course by Goren Gordon at TAU.

In this project we learn the formulation of curiosity proposed by prof. Gordon in several papers, in particular (Gordon  et al., [2012](http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/80855c_e23ff5655de44647b2269b47dfaab589.pdf), Moran et al., [2019](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/8c0099_cdde28eda25c472da31bd81a5cee5238.pdf)).

We use this approach in order to build and examine adversarial examples, we are mostly based on paper by Goodfellow  et al., [2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf)
